# Baked macaroni and cheese is a quintessential southern side dish.", ingredients: "1 lbs macaroni, 1 stick butter melted, 4 cup extra-sharp cheddar cheese, 2 cup Colby jack-cheddar blend, 3 large eggs, 2 cup whole milk, Salt, Pepper", instructions: "Step 1
# Preheat oven to 350Â° and grease a large, deep baking dish with butter or cooking spray. In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook macaroni according to package instructions until just al dente. Drain, rinse with cold water and set aside.
# Step 2
# In a large bowl (or the same pot you used to cook the pasta), combine cooked pasta and butter and season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir in 2 cups cheddar cheese.
# Step 3
# Add half of the macaroni mixture to prepared baking dish. Sprinkle Colby-cheddar cheese blend over pasta mixture, then top with another layer of pasta (similar to making a lasagna).
# Step 4
# In a medium bowl, beat together eggs and milk then pour evenly over pasta.
# Step 5
# Cover baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 to 35 minutes. Do not overbake! It may be a bit jiggly when you take it out of the oven.
# Step 6
# Turn on oven broiler. Top with the remaining cheddar cheese. (I add a little more Colby jack as well) and broil until golden! It will firm up as it cool.", time: "50 Mins", servings: 8 , user_id:1)
